The project is aligned with the course because it examines AI not only as a computational tool, but as a socio-technical risk layer embedded in highly regulated financial systems. In this context, failures in AI-driven applications such as credit scoring, fraud detection, trading systems and automated decision-making may generate algorithmic bias, operational disruption, regulatory exposure and harm to customers.

Its connection with [**AI Security**]() lies in the need to monitor, evaluate and govern AI systems as critical assets. Its connection with **Cybersecurity** emerges from the broader perspective of resilience, data protection, operational control and incident response in adversarial financial environments. Its relationship with [**Social Engineering**]() appears in the ways AI can intensify manipulation, impersonation and trust-related risks in digital finance. Together, these dimensions justify the project’s focus on governance and regulatory compliance as central mechanisms for reducing AI-related risk.

## 1. Introduction

<br>

### 1.1 Business Context

The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in banking and financial services has expanded significantly across critical domains such as credit scoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, risk management, and customer operations.

While these systems improve efficiency and decision-making speed, they also introduce material risks related to **model bias**, **operational failures**, and **governance gaps**. For financial institutions, these risks translate directly into **regulatory exposure, reputational damage, and financial loss**.

This project analyzes real-world AI incident reports to support a structured understanding of how these risks emerge in financial environments, with a focus on **risk patterns, affected customer groups, and governance response effectiveness**.

<br>

### 1.2 Business Problem

Given a dataset of AI-related incidents filtered for the financial sector, this project addresses the following business questions:

- Are there **recurring risk patterns** associated with specific AI use cases (credit, fraud, trading)?
- Do certain **customer segments experience disproportionate impact** from AI-driven decisions?
- Are **governance and regulatory responses aligned with incident severity and risk level**?

<br>

### 1.3 Business Value for Financial Institutions

<br>

| Stakeholder | Business Value |
|---|---|
| Banks and Financial Institutions | Improved operational risk control and reduced exposure to model failures |
| Regulators | Data-driven supervision and better risk monitoring capabilities |
| Risk Management Teams | Enhanced visibility of AI-related operational risks |
| Compliance Departments | Identification of governance gaps and audit prioritization |
| Executive Leadership | Better understanding of AI risk impact on business performance and reputation |


<br><br>

> [!Note]
>
> This project demonstrates how AI incident data can be transformed into actionable risk indicators, predictive models, and API-driven monitoring systems, enabling continuous oversight and improved governance in financial environments.
